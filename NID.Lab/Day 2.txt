Building Evidence on NID (Thomas Escande (Analyst, World Bank DIME), Sylvan Herskowitz (Economist, World Bank DIME))
    - What is impact and Impact Evaluation
    - Importance of Impact Evaluation
        - Avoid false conclusions
        - Strong Evidence
        - Improve credibility and independent studies
        - Cost-Effectiveness
    - What Impact Evaluation so special
        - Differentiate Causality and Correlation that heppens at the same time
    - Why M&E is not enough?
        - M&E is extremely important. However, it doesn't show the impact based on the collected data.
    - What Impact Evaluation tells you
        - Short-term: Test/Improve implementation
        - Long-term: to measure impact on outcomes.
    - Impact Evaluation Theory
        - compare a group of program beneficiaries
        - comparison group with the same characteristics.
        - comparison group that is eposed to the same trends and shocks over time.
    - Randomization
        - best method to create valid comparison group for impact evaluation if the sample is large enough.
        - Randomization Process
            - Generating sameple in represntative of the population.
            - Creating a valid comparison group
            - Measuring outcomes to estimate impact
        - In Practice: Mutiple Methods
            - Randomization interventions to improvie take-up or pilots linking to NID services.
            - Stagger rollout by location and time.
            - Questions like...
                - NID authentication improve 4Ps delivery?
                    - Intervention between the timeline
                        - Baseline (new)
                        - Midline (12 mo)
                        - Endline (18 mo)
    - Retroactive Evaluations
        - impact after the program has been implemented, looking for valid comparison groups ex-post.
    - Prospective Evaluations
        - developed during program design and built into program implemnetation.
    - Complementary Research
        - "Gold Standard" to generate rigorous causal Evidence
        - combination of different complementary approaches.
            - Impact Evaluations
            - Descriptive studies
            - Mixed methods and qualitative approaches
    - Impact Evaluation Examples
        - ID and Social Welfare in India (Aadhaar System)
            - Impacts of biometric smartcards on social welfare programs in Andhra Pradesh
            - Impacts of Aadhaar on the Public Distribution SYstem in Jharkhand
        - Fingerprinting for Loan Enforcement in Malawi
        - Biometrics for beneficiaries of the BISP cash transfer program in Pakistan
    - Early Piloting
        - Learning early will have great impacts in ability to adjust and optimize programs.
        - RCTs are the gold standard approach.
